## 💻 About this project

This project proposal was to fetch an API from [The Movie Database TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and display a movie image and description every click from the button. It's a **challenge** provided by the [Rocketseat's Discover trail](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/discover).

I'll be happy if you could send me any feedback about the project, code, structure or anything that you can report that could make me better as a developer!

And you can use this project as you wish!
